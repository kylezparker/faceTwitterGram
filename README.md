This is a social media website.



This project still needs work in may areas. accounts/urls, accounts/models, accounts/views all need work. world/urls, world/models, world/views. 

The above needs to be taken care of for CRUD. After that the social media part of the site must be implemented. 

For now, there are two basic parts: "friends" is where one can post messages only friends can see, like fb status; "world" is where one can post messages for the world to see, like twitter.
